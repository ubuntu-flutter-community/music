# Contributing

Contributions are highly welcome. Especially translations.
Please [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) MusicPod to your GitHub namespace, [clone](https://docs.github.com/de/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) it to your computer, create a branch named by yourself, commit your changes to your local branch, push them to your fork and then make a pull request from your fork to this repository.
I recommend the vscode extension [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) especially for people new to [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey).

## Translations
For translations into your language change the corresponding `app_xx.arb` file where `xx` is the language code of your language in lower case.
If the file does not exist yet please create it and copy the `whole` content of app_en.arb into it and change only the values to your translation but leave the keys untouched.
The vscode extension [arb editor by Google](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.arb-editor) is highly recommended to avoid arb syntax errors.
Also recommended is the [Google Translate Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=funkyremi.vscode-google-translate).

## Code contributions

If you find any error please feel free to report it as an issue and describe it as good as you can.
If you want to contribute code, please create an issue first.

## Testing

Test mocks are generated with [Mockito](https://github.com/dart-lang/mockito). You need to run the `build_runner` command in order to re-generate mocks, in case you changed the signatures of service methods.

`flutter pub run build_runner build`
